## Installing and Setup

### Installing from Source

If you want the latest nightly version of AutoDiffX, clone from our github
repository and install the latest version directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CS207-Project-Team-1/cs207-FinalProject autodiffx
cd autodiffx
python3 setup.py install
```

If you are working on a python virtual environment or Mac OSX or your user's
python distribution, this should work. If editing the system python, you may
need to run the last command with root permissions by adding `sudo`.

### Installing from pip

For the stable version, you can install our package from PyPI.

```bash
pip install autodiffx
```
