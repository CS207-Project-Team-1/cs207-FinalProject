    "Differentiation is ubiquitous in almost all aspects of computer science, mathematics, and physics. It is used for numeric root-finding as in Newton's Method, and used for optimization with different forms of gradient descent.\n",
    "However, calculating analytic derivatives is difficult and can lead to exponentially growing abstract syntax trees, which makes finding the derivative infeasible in many cases.\n",
    "Similarly, calculating the derivative numerically using the limit definition runs into numeric instabilities due to limited machine precision.\n",
    "Automatic differentiation addresses both of these issues - it uses the chain rule and the fact that computers calculate any function as a sequence of elementary operations to find the derivative."

    "Automatic differentiation relies heavily on the principles of chain rule differentiation. A graph of elementary functions is built to calculate the values of more complex functions. Using the chain rule on the graph of elementary functions, the value of the derivative at each node can also be calculated. This gives us the ability to calculate the values of functions and their derivatives, no matter how complex, to near machine precision (a significant advantage compared to alternatives such as finite differences). \n",
